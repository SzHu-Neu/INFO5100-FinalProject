# INFO5100-FinalProject



## Criteria

1. Late Submission
2. Demo and presentation
3. What's the system used for? Which issue has it solved? How well has it solved the issue?
4. Is the system applicable or expandable at the global level?
5. Show how multiple parties (or countries) can work together to solve the issue which you mean to solve.
6. At least 4 enterprises and 8 organization
7. At least 3 work requests between enterprises and at least a total of 4 work requests in the whole system.
8. Is the eco-system built between multiple enterprises joined together?
9. Manage the communication between enterprise and organization by the usage of Work Requests
10. Logical alignment with the real-time process.
    e.g. One doctor can't handle 2 patients at the same time.
11. Must provide proper logging(tracking) or an overview of what has been going on with the whole system.
    i.e. The status of each work request.
12. IMPORTANT: Bug-free Application no errors have to be present in the application. (1 error => -5 marks and program break => -20 marks)
13. Database support: At least the DB4O database. You could use other kinds of external databases like MongoDB, MySQL, etc. And you need to figure out the interface between your application and database. In this way, you may confront many difficulties in your project, and TA will not help you fix the problem with your external database. Besides, the external database may increase your performance and enrich your functionalities of the project, but only using the external database will not get bonus marks (The external database is not in our grading criteria, but program performance and functionalities are).
14. Does the system implement all the requirements in your submitted problem statement?
15. Good UI design (use of colors, layouts, proportionality, symmetry, etc.)
16. Good UX (Are users able to use the system with simple tutorials?)
17. Use of Java Swing Alerts Dialog
18. Bonus & Optional: Advanced java features.
19. Multiple commits are required. Your commit history must show your work progress during these weeks. One single commit will directly lead to another precious change to study this course from Prof.Kal in another semester. 20. Multiple branches are required. Each member in your team must have your own branch. Project reviewer will do grading based on your contribution(commits history and contribution part, not just based on the number of lines)
